This weeked I attended my first hackathon and completed my second project. Using Python, the Twitter api, and the Google Maps api my goal was to make a public trash can finder in Philadelphia to help prevent litter.

### How does it work?

This app has two parts. The Twitter bot and the web-page. They do similar things; initailly I only planned to make the webpage but then thought a Twitter bot would be a nice feature. Both leverage a users current location and subsequentally Tweet or display the three closest pubic trash cans in Philadelphia. This data was gathered from the [https://www.opendataphilly.org](https://www.opendataphilly.org). A catalog of open data for the Philadelphia region.



The core component of this project is interacting with the Twitter api and Google maps api.
