This weeked I attended my first hackathon and completed my second side project. Using Python, Twitter api, and Google Maps api my goal was to make a public trash can finder in Philadelphia to help prevent litter.

### How does it work?

This app has two parts. The Twitter bot and the web-page. They do similar things; initailly I only planned to make the webpage but then thought a Twitter bot would be a nice feature. Both leverage a users current location and subsequentally Tweet or display the three closest pubic trash cans in Philadelphia. This data was gathered from the [https://www.opendataphilly.org](https://www.opendataphilly.org). A catalog of open data for the Philadelphia region.



The core component of this project is interacting with the Twitter api and Google maps api.



### Conclusion

I am very happy with this project. After my first project I've been antsy to start a second one but couldn't get the ball moving on what exactly I wanted to build. I was however, and have been for awhile, passionate about in some way trying tryint to use technology to assist the litter and waste problem in Philadelphia. Additionally, I have been wanting to build a project that interats with api's. Naturally it seamed like the next step in teaching myself CS realted things. So naturally everything kind of aligned and I was able to build a really cool project at a hackathon this weekend. The best part, I got to use Frank Reynolds as the avatar.
