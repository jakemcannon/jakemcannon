I'm feeling inspired to learn JavaScript, a language I often curse, after feeling uninspired with Python. Sure, there are many more nuances to learn about Python, but, at the moment I don't feel particularly challenged with learning the language. I have built some small scripts, a REST API, etc. and I don't care to go down the data science rabbit whole. Hopefully, after learning JavaScript I can create MVP's and full-stack web apps more quickly.



### Outline

I'm roughly aware of some of the key JavaScript features to know as well as the popular frameworks. So, the idea is to build as many projects in a gradual formation. As of now, I'm thinking the projects will look something like the following.



**Generator:**

This would likely be one static webpage that generates, perhaps, a random word or picture from an API.

**Connect two API's**

Again, I imagine this will be another static page, so no users or authentication, but I will try to make it more challenging by combining two APIs. i.e. Weather API and Spotify API to play music depending on the mood/weather.

**Chrome Extension**

I'm not sure how hard this one will be but, to me at least, I think I can build something more practical and I or others would use as opposed to a web app.

**Blog/Dashboard/CRM (No auth yet)**

The focus here will be on, I think, DOM manipulation. In the past, I have had a hard time mapping a JSON API and deconstructing it, into some frontend elements such as cards. With this project, I hope to work on those challenges before moving on to a fulls-tack app with users/authentication, etc.

**Full Stack Web App**

The optimistic project I would like to build is a *100 days of X* web app that actually tracks users' progress and connects users. Nonetheless, any web app should suffice.





### Week 1:



I believe it has only been 3 days but the programming is coming along well. I have neally completed the generator project. The majority of the app is done. Anything remaing is tests or things such as Docker and cloud hosting. this small project actually turned out to be fun and helpful as it allows you to tinker with a large bredth of technologies/modern software life cycles without a large cumbersome web app. Less chance of getting stuck in configuration hell.
