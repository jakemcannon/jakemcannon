# 100 Days of JavaScript

I'm feeling inspired to learn JavaScript, a language I often curse, after feeling undispired with Python. Sure, there is much more nuances to learn about Python, but, at the moment I don't fell particuallry challenged with learning the language. I have built some small scripts, a REST API, etc. and I don't really care to go down the data science rabbit whole. Hopefully, after learning JavaScript I can create MVP's and full stack web apps more quickly.



### Outline

I'm roughly aware of some of the key JavaScript features to know as well as the popular frameworkds. So, the idea is to build is many projects in a gradual formation. As of now, I'm thinking the projects will looks something like this.



**Generator:**

This would likely be one static webpage that generates, perhaps, a random word

**Connect two API's**

Again, I imagine this will be another static page, so no users or authentication, but I will try to make it more challenging by combining two API's. i.e. Weather API and Spotify API to play music depening on the mood/weather.

**Chrome Extension**

I'm not sure how hard this one will be but, to me atleast, I think I can build something thats's more practical and I or others would use as opposed to a webapp.

**Blog/Dashboard/CRM (No auth yet)**

The focus here will be on, I think, DOM manipulation. In the past I have had a hard time with mapping a JSON API, and deconstructing it, into some frontend elements such as cards. With this project I hope to work on those challenges before moving on to a full scale app with users/authentication etc.

**Full Stack Web App**

The, perhaps, optimistic project I would like to build is actually a *100 days of X* webapp that actaully tracks users and connects users. Nonetheless, any webapp should suffice.
