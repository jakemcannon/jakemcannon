I'm a current junior at [Temple University](https://www.temple.edu/) working on a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

In class, I'm currently studying Data Structures and Discrete Math II. Outside of class, I'm currently studying <code>Java</code>, <code>Python</code>, TDD, and how to work with API's and databases.

My current projects can be found on my [github](https://github.com/jakemcannon). My resume can be found [here](current_resume.pdf). Additionally, If you would like to contact me about work opportunities or side-projects my email is jakemcannon@gmail.com
