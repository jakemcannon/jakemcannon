I'm a current junior at Temple University studying Computer Science.

In class, I'm currently studying Data Structures and Discrete Math II. Outside of class, I'm currently studying <code>Java</code>, <code>Python</code>, TDD, and how to work with API's and databases.

I have a passion for technology and tend to gravitate towards complexity. My current projects can be found on my [here](https://github.com/jakemcannon). My resume can be found here.
