### Solution

For the input num you will have many `x` + `y` that `==` the given number. Just implement it, try all sets of `x` and `y`. I will use an example with `num = 11` below.

Notice that after the value halfway between `1` and `num`, the `x` and `y` pairs are the same but reversed. This means we can limit the problem to only half the range. Either `range(1, num//2)` or `range(num//2, num+1)`.

```
1, 10
2, 9
3, 8
4, 7
5, 6
--- middle ---
6, 5
7, 4
8, 3
9, 2
10, 1
```

We can simply loop from the `range(num//2, num+1)` and reverse every num. Then, check that `current_value` + `reversed_value` == `num` .

### Code

```python
def solve(num):
    if num == 0:
        return True
    if num == 1:
        return False
    for x in range(num//2, num+1):
        x_rev = int(str(x)[::-1])
        if x + x_rev == num:
            return True
    return False
```
