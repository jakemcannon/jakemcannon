- Canonical GCD problem
- Simple [[GCD]] function where the inputs `a` and `b` are the `min()` and `max()` from some array.

### Solution

You can calculate the GCD of two numbers like the following

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return gcd(b, a%b)
```

Now just get the `min` and `max` from the input array.

### Code

```python
def solve(arr):

    a = max(arr)
    b = min(arr)

    while a:
        if b == 0:
            break
        a = b
        b = a % b

    return a
```
