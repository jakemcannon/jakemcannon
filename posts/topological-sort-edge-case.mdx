title: Topological Sort Edge Case
date: 2022-10-30

With these problems the description states something like the following:

For some topsort problems you are given two inputs

- An integer `n` representing the number of nodes
- Some array of edges -> `[[a1, b1], [a2, b2]]`

It is possible that there is some node that _is on an island by itself_. It won't appear in the `edges` input. So don't forget to include it in your adjacency list.

### Example

```
n = 6
edges = [[
	[1, 2],
	[2, 3],
	[4, 3],
	[3, 5]
]]
```
