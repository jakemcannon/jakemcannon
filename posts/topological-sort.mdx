- If you need to "detect a cycle in a directed graph" this should be your go to problem
- I learned this simplification from Colin Galen video[0]

# Def:

- Its not a graph but an _ordering_ of a graph
- Common verbiage to use with the pattern is: for every directed edge `edge(u, v)` `U` comes before `V` in the ordering

### A very nice pattern and terminology for thinking about topsort

TODO: This algo has a name. Something starting with a C

### WIP

source
sink

```python
def test():
  return "testing syntax highlighting"
```

### pseudo code

Find the source(s) first and start building your linear ordering with these first source(s). Remove these sources, their direct children, will become the next sources. Repeat.

1. Initialization

- Build an adjacency list graph -> {}
- Build a "in-degree" frequency hashmap

2.
